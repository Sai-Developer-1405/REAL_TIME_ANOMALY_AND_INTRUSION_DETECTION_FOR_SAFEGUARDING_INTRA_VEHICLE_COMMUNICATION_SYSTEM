# Real-Time-Anomaly-and-Intrusion-Detection-for-Safeguarding-Intra-Vehicle-Communication-System
This project enhances electric vehicle security by detecting cyber threats in intra-vehicle communication using an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Social Spider Optimization (SSO), ensuring real-time anomaly detection and intrusion prevention against attacks like Denial-of-Service (DoS).
